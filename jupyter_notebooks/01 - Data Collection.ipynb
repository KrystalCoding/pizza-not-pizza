    "## Key Steps\n",
    "1. Dataset Exploration:\n",
    "* Explore the \"Pizza or Not Pizza\" dataset, understanding its structure, and visualizing sample images.\n",
    "* Check for class imbalances and ensure a diverse representation of pizza variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Processing:\n",
    "* Handle missing or corrupted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Labeling:\n",
    "* Ensure clear labeling of images for supervised learning.\n",
    "* Verify that each image is correctly labeled according to its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dataset Splitting:\n",
    "* Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Dataset Summary:\n",
    "* Provide a summary of the dataset statistics, including the number of samples in each class.\n",

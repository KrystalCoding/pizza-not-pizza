        f"* Malaria is a parasitic infection transmitted by the bite of infected female "
        f"Anopheles mosquitoes.\n"
        f"* A blood smear sample is collected, mixed with a reagent and examined in "
        f"the microscope. Visual criteria are used to detect malaria parasites.\n"
        f"* According to [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria), "
        f"in 2019, there were an estimated  229 million cases of malaria worldwide and an "
        f"estimated 409 thousand deaths due to this disease. "
        f"Children <5 years are the most vulnerable group, accounting for 67% (274 thousand) "
        f"of all malaria deaths worldwide in 2019.\n\n"
        f"**Project Dataset**\n"
        f"* The available dataset contains 5643 out of +27 thousand images taken from "
        f"blood smear workflow (when a drop of blood is taken on a glass slide) of "
        f"malaria-parasitised and uninfected cells.")

        f"The project has 2 business requirements:\n"
        f"* 1 - The client is interested in having a study to differentiate "
        f"a parasitized and uninfected cell visually.\n"
        f"* 2 - The client is interested in telling whether a given cell contains a malaria parasite or not. "
